### Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and
services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform
so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using
`java -jar` or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool
that runs spring scripts.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all
Spring development
* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to
diverge from the defaults
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
(e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
